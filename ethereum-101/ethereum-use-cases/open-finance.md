# Open Finance

Traditional finance is great for people. Traditional finance replaces transactions backed by the threat of physical violence. In many parts of the world, lending is secured by the organized crime. When the rule of law is established and the state gains an enduring monopoly on the coercive use of physical violence, the state can establish an incomplete but functional version of trustlessness within the economy. Finance is backed by the centralized coercion of the court system. Developed societies enjoy benefits of complex finance layers in the form of functional low margin consumer lending, active insurance markets and the equity market robustness needed to enable venture financing. The people of less developed nation-states have no access to these utility spinners.

Open finance is over the top solution for trustfuless available to all societies with an internet connection without any socialized cost that must be paid by a centralized entity with the power to tax. 

Lending in ancient societies was backed by whatever was available, typically the threat of violence and/or property confiscation. That was better than nothing but still not good. Groups in those societies that could deliver credible threats of violence had many paths to monetize their power. When they choose lending over theft and extortion, the interest rate was quite high.

As liberal democracies built out functioning judicial systems, citizens grew to expect the law would be fairly adjudicated. Lending blossomed into finance, but why? A state with an enduring monopoly on the threat of violence and coercion is a prerequisite for maintaining a functioning judiciary system, and a functioning judiciary system is a prerequisite for the minimum trustlessness necessary to conduct finance. The development of finance affords society competitive consumer lending, efficient insurance markets, venture capital and many other. The core functions of finance deliver  quality of life improvements to those humans lucky enough to live in these select nation-states.

Ethereum decouples the reliance on trustful contracts to be enforced by someone with a monopoly on coercive violence. By abstracting the rules that will govern a financial transaction into a smart contract on ethereum, the counterparties in the agreement can be confindent that those rules will be followed as decentralized consensus is established by the ethereum consensus mechanism.

Ethereum-centric open finance projects include:
